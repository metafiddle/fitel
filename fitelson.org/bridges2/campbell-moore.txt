Self-Referential Probability

Abstract.  I consider languages which have sentences that can talk about their own probability. I discuss reasons that we might be interested in them and one particular challenge that they pose: how can one develop a semantics for these languages. I shall also briefly outline one proposed semantics which is based on a Kripke-style construction for theories of truth.
