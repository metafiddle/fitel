Such violations include cheating  on an exam, helping someone else to cheat, resubmitting a paper written for  another class,  and plagiarism.The official university policy on academic integrity can be found on-line at:</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>  <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp?id=1143&rcol=1201http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp?id=1143&rcol=1201"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp?id=1143&amp;rcol=1201</font></a></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>  Plagiarism is the representation of someone else&#8217;s words or ideas as  one&#8217;s  own. The most egregious cases of plagiarism are easy to avoid because theyare so obviously dishonest:</font></p><ul>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turning in someone else&#8217;s      paper as your own<br>  </font></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Allowing someone else to turn      in a copy of your paper as his or her own<br>  </font></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Downloading a paper from the      internet and altering it a little to fit the class<br>  </font></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Employing a &#8220;research      service&#8221;<br>  </font></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Be warned: GSIs are quite experienced at detecting such deception. </font></li></ul><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other cases of plagiarism are more subtle. Sometimes students plagiarize    unwittingly, out of carelessness or ignorance of the standards for attributing    ideas to    their sources. However, ignorance is no excuse. You are responsible for knowing    the    standards and taking care to follow them.<br>    <br>  Whenever you make use of another&#8217;s words or ideas in a paper, you must    give proper credit. Usually this means inserting a footnote or a parenthetical    reference. If you&#8217;re not sure how to give a proper reference, consult    a style guide or your GSI. Your GSI can also answer questions about when    you must    give a reference. If in doubt, play it safe.<br>    <br>  You must provide a reference not only when you use the exact words of another,    but also when you paraphrase her words, summarize her ideas, or borrow her    metaphors.<br>    <br>  When you do use someone&#8217;s exact words, be sure to mark them as such,    either by putting them in quotation marks or by setting them off from the    main text    and indenting them on both sides. Be careful not to change the wording at    all in a direct quotation; if you must change it, use square brackets to    indicate    your changes.<br>    <br>  When you paraphrase, state the author&#8217;s ideas in your own words. Don&#8217;t    just rearrange the words in the sentence and replace some of the words with synonyms.    Note: even though you&#8217;re using your own words, you still need to give    a reference, since the idea is not yours.<br>    </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>  Finally, if you work with another student on your paper, acknowledge this    in a footnote. </font></p></body></html>
