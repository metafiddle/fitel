      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We are in the process of organizing our eighth annual formal epistemology workshop. The purpose of these workshops is to bring together  faculty and graduate students with an interest in the use of formal methods in epistemology (broadly construed) in small, focused meetings. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</font></p>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
          <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ampliative inference (including inductive logic);</FONT></li>
          <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Foundations of probability and statistics;</FONT></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Epistemic Logics and theories of belief revision;</font></li>
          <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Game theory and decision theory (including social choice theory);</FONT></li>
          <li>Issues at the  interface between formal and traditional epistemology.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The eighth workshop is  scheduled for <strong>May 19 &ndash;  21, 2011</strong> and will be held at the University of Southern California. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We are  now accepting submissions for FEW 2011. Please send submissions by email to <a href="../../index.html">Branden Fitelson</a>.<strong> Submissions are due &mdash; in the form of full papers &mdash; by March 1, 2011</strong>; notifications of acceptance either as definite presenters or as alternates will be sent out by <strong>April 1, 2011</strong>. </font>It is likely that some of the papers presented at FEW 2011  will appear in a special issue of the<em> <a href="http://www.springer.com/philosophy/logic/journal/10992">Journal of Philosophical Logic</a></em>.</p>
      <p align="left">In addition to contributed papers, we will also have three keynote lectures. We are delighted to have the following three keynote speakers this year: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mcolyvan/colyvan.html">Mark Colyvan</a>, <a href="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/cricky/profile">Chris Hitchcock</a>, and <a href="http://www.sts.vt.edu/faculty/mayo/mayo.htm">Deborah Mayo</a>.</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those interested in participating in the workshop (<em>e.g.</em>, by commenting on a paper or helping with organization, <em>etc</em>.) should contact one of the organizers listed below. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We will be able to contribute <strong>$250</strong> in travel funds for  each graduate student who presents or comments on a paper. </font> Our funding is limited this year, however, so it is unlikely that we will be able to provide funding for people who are not on the program.</p>
