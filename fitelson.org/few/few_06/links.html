See the <a href="schedule.html">schedule page</a> for details about the timing of sessions.</p><p align="left" class="style2">Some general &quot;Berkeley-relevant&quot;   information is included below.<br>  <br>  Lots of information about visiting Berkeley can be found <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/visitors/">here</a>. Specific directions to The Lipman Room can be found <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/lipman/LipmanMap.html">here</a>.<br>  <br>  Since <a href="http://pt.berkeley.edu/parking/index.html">parking</a> is limited on the campus, we strongly advise using <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/visitors/public_transit.html">public transportation</a>. <a href="http://bart.gov/index.asp">BART</a> runs regularly (between 5am and midnight, around every 20 minutes) from campus to both the <a href="http://www.flyoakland.com/bart_airbart.shtml">Oakland</a> and <a href="http://www.flysfo.com/transport/services/gt_tsv_search.asp?gt_mode_id=4">SFO</a> airports (the Oakland airport is closest to Berkeley), and the cost is minimal. Taxis tend to be  more expensive. <br>  <br>Maps of the campus and the city (showing the location of BART next to campus) are available <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?name=&addr=2160+Shattuck+Ave&state=CA&csz=Berkeley,+CA+94704-1307&ds=n&uzip=94704&mag=2&desc=&country=US&dma=807&cat=comm&resize=l&trf=0&lat=37.870058&lon=-122.267973&mlt=37.870058&mln=-122.267973&rezoom=0&.intl=us&addrtype=12&compass=&i_ov=0&appid=&pan_x=0&pan_y=0&panable=1">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bart.gov/stations/stationGuide/localAreaMap_BRK.asp?zoom=9&nlat=378698&nlng=-1222679">here</a>. </p><p align="left" class="style2">There are various hotels not far from the campus (some affiliated with the University and some not). Two good lists are to be found <a href="https://calrentals.housing.berkeley.edu/flyers/Hotels_Motels.asp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/calparents/guide/visiting/stay.html">here</a>. We advise making reservations soon.  Also, <a href="http://www.hotelsanddeals.com/university_of_california_berkeley.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g32066-Berkeley_California-Hotels.html">here</a> are two more lists of nearby hotels. <br>  <br>Of course, it goes without saying that there are tons of attractions in <a href="http://www.visitberkeley.com/">Berkeley</a>, <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.com/attractions/index.shtml">San Francisco</a>, and the rest of the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/">Bay Area</a>. </p><p align="left" class="style2">If you have any questions about travel, <em>etc.</em>, please contact Branden [<a href="mailto:branden@fitelson.org">branden@fitelson.org</a>]. <strong>Note: we do have some funds this year for graduate student travel (mainly, for those on <a href="schedule.html">the program</a>). </strong>If you are a graduate student, please ask Branden about this. Also, we should be able to find accommodations for most graduate students (with our own students here in Berkeley). Please contact Branden about that as well. </p></body></html>
