"A Dilemma For Jeffrey Conditionalizers"

Abstract:  A rule for updating degrees of belief should be commutative:
if the same total information is gleaned then the same degrees of belief
should result, regardless of the order in which the information is
learned.  Commutativity is an old worry for Jeffrey Conditionalization,
since the order in which values are put into the rule makes a difference
to the end result.   The worry seems to have been resolved in recent
work  by Lange (2000) and Wagner (2002).  But I argue that, to resolve
the commutativity problem we must give up another important desideratum
on updating rules: holism.  Holism requires that the effect sensory
input has on one's corpus of beliefs be sensitive to one's background
beliefs.  When an object looks red, whether or not we should judge that
it is red depends on what we think about the lighting, the reliability
of our vision, etc.  Since preserving commutativity means giving up
holism, proponents of Jeffrey Conditionalization face a troubling
dilemma: they may have commutativity or holism, but not both.
