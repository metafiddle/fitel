Belief Revision in a Dynamic Epistemic Framework

We show how belief revision can be treated systematically in the format
of current dynamic-epistemic logics, with belief operators added in a
suitable manner. The core engine are update rules for preference
relations which have been proposed independently in the dynamic
epistemic literature for preference change. The result of this analysis
are some complete sets of reduction axioms for particular revision
mechanisms, as well as standard modal correspondence analysis for
revision postulates in general AGM style.
