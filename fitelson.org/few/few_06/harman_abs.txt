"Induction and Simplicity"

Gilbert Harman and Sanjeev Kulkarni, Princeton University


We are concerned with the reliability of inductive methods in the light
of certain foundational results in statistical learning theory.  In this
talk, we compare simple enumerative induction with methods that take
into account some ordering of hypotheses, perhaps by simplicity.  We
compare different methods for balancing data-coverage against an
ordering of hypotheses in terms of simplicity or some simplicity
substitute.  Then we consider how ideas from statistical learning theory
might shed light on some philosophical issues.  In particular, we
distinguish two ways to respond to Goodman's (1965) "new riddle of
induction", corresponding to these two kinds of inductive methods.  We
discuss some of Karl Popper's ideas about scientific method, trying to
distinguish what is right and what is wrong about these ideas.  We
consider how the two sorts of induction discussed in this talk might
apply to first language acquisition.  And finally, we consider how an
appeal to simplicity or some similar ordering might provide a principled
way to prefer one hypothesis over another skeptical hypothesis that is
empirically equivalent with it.
