<p align="center"><strong><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Annual Formal Epistemology Workshops</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We are in the process of organizing our sixth annual formal epistemology workshop (the <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/few_09/few_04">first</a>, <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/few_09/few_05">second</a>,  <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/few_09/few_06">third</a>, <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/few_09/few_07">fourth</a>, and <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/few_09/few_08">fifth</a> workshops were all great successes). The purpose of these workshops is to bring together individuals, both faculty and graduate students, using mathematical methods in epistemology in small focused meetings. Topics treated will include but are not limited to:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ampliative inference (including inductive logic);</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Game theory and decision theory;</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Formal learning theory;</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Formal theories of coherence:</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Foundations of probability and statistics;</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Formal approaches to paradoxes of belief and/or action;</FONT></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Belief revision;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Causal discovery.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides papers with respondents, each workshop will typically include short introductory tutorials (two or three topically related presentations) on formal methods. These tutorials will be oriented particularly to graduate students. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The sixth workshop is  scheduled for  <strong>June 18 &ndash; June 21, 2009</strong> and will be held at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.  We are  now accepting submissions for FEW 2009. Please send submissions by email to <a href="../../index.html">Branden</a>.<strong> Submissions are due &mdash; in the form of full papers &mdash; by Sunday, March 15, 2009</strong>; notifications of acceptance either as definite presenters or as alternates will be sent out by <strong><font color="#000000">Thursday, April 30, 2009</font></strong><font color="#000000">.</font></font> Some of the papers presented at FEW 2009  will appear in a special issue of the<em> <a href="http://www.springer.com/philosophy/logic/journal/10992">Journal of Philosophical Logic</a></em>.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those interested in participating, either by presenting papers, responding, or providing tutorials, or in helping with organization, should contact one of the local organizers listed below.  We can contribute <strong>$250</strong> in travel funds for  every graduate student who presents or comments on a paper. We are also able to contribute <strong>$200</strong> in travel costs for a number (to be determined) of graduate students who attend the workshop without presenting or commenting on a paper. Priority will be given to graduate students who have not attended previous workshops, and to women and minorities. Graduate students who wish to be considered for travel funding should contact <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-kelly.php">Kevin Kelly</a> (the local organizer this year) by May 1, 2009.</font></p>
