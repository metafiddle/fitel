The purpose of these workshops is to bring together individuals, both faculty and graduate students, using mathematical methods in epistemology in small focused meetings. Topics treated will include but are not limited to:</font></p><ul>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ampliative inference (including inductive logic);</FONT></li>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Game theory and decision theory;</FONT></li>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Formal learning theory;</FONT></li>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Formal theories of coherence:</FONT></li>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Foundations of probability and statistics;</FONT></li>  <li><FONT size="3" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Formal approaches to paradoxes of belief and/or action;</FONT></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Belief revision;</font></li>  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Causal discovery.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides papers with respondents, each workshop will typically include short introductory tutorials (three or four topically related presentations) on formal methods. These tutorials will be oriented particularly to graduate students. </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fifth workshop is  scheduled for  <strong>May 14&ndash;18, 2008</strong> and will be held at <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/">UW&ndash;Madison</a>.  We are  now accepting submissions for FEW 2008. Please send submissions by email to <a href="mailto:vranas@wisc.edu">Peter Vranas</a>. <strong>Submissions are due &mdash; in the form of full papers &mdash;</strong> <strong> by Friday, February 15 2008</strong>; notifications of acceptance either as definite presenters or as alternates will be sent out by <strong><font color="#000000">Friday, March 14, 2008</font></strong><font color="#000000">.</font></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those interested in participating, either by presenting papers, responding, or providing tutorials, or in helping with organization, should contact one of the local organizers listed below.  We can contribute $500 in travel funds for  every graduate student who presents or comments on a paper. We are also able to contribute $250 in travel costs for a number (to be determined) of graduate students who attend the workshop without presenting or commenting on a paper. Priority will be given to graduate students who have not attended previous workshops, and to women and minorities. Graduate students who wish to be considered for travel funding should contact <a href="mailto:vranas@wisc.edu">Peter Vranas</a> by March 15, 2008.</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/vranas/web/index.htm">Peter Vranas</a><br>    <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster/">Malcolm Forster</a></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>    UW&ndash;Madison</font></p></body></html>
