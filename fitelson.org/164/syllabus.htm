<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2"></A> 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Course Reading Materials
<EM>&amp;</EM> Schedule (tentative!)</H2>

<P>We will be using the following materials for the course (in
chronological order):&nbsp;</P>

<OL type=1>
   <LI><A HREF="http://hypatia.ss.uci.edu/lps/home/fac-staff/faculty/skyrms/"><TT>Brian
   Skyrms</TT></A>' book <A HREF="http://e-catalog.thomsonlearning.com/110/lpext.dll?f=XMLHitList&qf=DCQuery&ht=catalog.xml&d=Wadsworth/0534557376&sf=item&p=&po=&q=%255Bfield%2CISBN%253A0534557376%255D&list=ProductIsbnIssnFormatted&xsl=productdescription.xsl&p1=0-534-55737-6" TARGET="_blank"><I>Choice
   and Chance</I></A> (fourth edition). We will begin by reading
   chapters 1, 2, 6, and 8 of <A HREF="http://e-catalog.thomsonlearning.com/110/lpext.dll?f=XMLHitList&qf=DCQuery&ht=catalog.xml&d=Wadsworth/0534557376&sf=item&p=&po=&q=%255Bfield%2CISBN%253A0534557376%255D&list=ProductIsbnIssnFormatted&xsl=productdescription.xsl&p1=0-534-55737-6" TARGET="_blank"><I>Choice
   and Chance</I></A>. These chapters will set the stage for the
   course, by introducing many of the basic logical and analytical
   tools we'll be using. <B>Approximate dates</B>: 9/27-10/9.<BR>
   <BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><EM>Philosophy 164/264 Course Reader</EM> (which contains
   excerpts from several books and articles). This will be the main
   source for our discussion of confirmation theory. <B>Approximate
   dates</B>: 10/11-11/6.<BR>
   <BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/salmon.html"><TT>Wesley
   Salmon</TT></A>'s book <EM>Four Decades of Scientific
   Explanation</EM>. This book is an encyclopedic classic, and we
   will read several of its chapters. <B>Approximate dates</B>:
   11/8-11/29.
   
   <P type=1>
   
   <HR>
   
   </P></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/~curd/"><TT>Curd</TT></A>
   and <A HREF="http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/~jacover/"><TT>Cover</TT></A>'s
   collection of papers: <A HREF="http://www.wwnorton.com/college/phil/science/contents.htm"><TT><EM>Central
   Issues in Philosophy of Science</EM></TT></A>. Only a couple of
   articles will be relevant from this collection (that's why it is
   labeled ``optional'' at the bookstore). So, you may not want to
   buy this one (it will be on reserve anyway). It's a great book to
   own. It not only contains many seminal papers, but it also has
   some good commentary as well.<BR>
   <BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI><B><U>Time Permitting</U></B>: We will read bits of <A HREF="http://www.scar.utoronto.ca/~kukla/webpage.html"><TT>Andre
   Kukla</TT></A>'s book <EM>Studies in Scientific Realism</EM> (it
   is doubtful that we'll get to this). This book should have been
   listed as ``optional'' at the bookstore. You may not want to buy
   this one (or you may want to return it if you have already bought
   it - you can always get the relevant bits later, from the reserve
   copy). Approximate (possible) dates: 12/4-12/6.</LI>
</OL>

<P>All of these items are currently available from the <A HREF="http://www.stanfordbookstore.com/"><TT>Stanford
Bookstore</TT></A>. Copies of each are also on reserve at the
<A HREF="http://www-philosophy.stanford.edu/tl.html"><TT>Tanner
Library</TT></A> in the <A HREF="http://www-philosophy.stanford.edu/"><TT>Philosophy
Department</TT></A> (<A HREF="map_90.gif"><TT>Building
90</TT></A>).</P>

<P>Occasionally, I will supplement the readings with my own handouts
(mainly, for the purpose of distributing paper topics, lecture notes,
<EM>etc</EM>.). I will usually distribute paper copies of these
handouts to the class. Moreover, electronic versions of the handouts
will always be posted on the class website:</P>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/fitelson/164"><FONT SIZE="+1"><TT>http://philosophy.wisc.edu/fitelson/164</TT></FONT></A></CENTER>

<P>Handouts will typically be posted in <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/adobepdf.html"><TT>Adobe
Acrobat PDF</TT></A> format, and will require Adobe's <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html"><TT>Acrobat
Reader</TT></A> software (version 3.01 or later) to be viewed,
printed, etc.</P>

<P>Whenever possible, I will try to disseminate important course
information and updates both in class and <EM>via</EM> email (I'm
setting up a course email list this week). So, <EM>please check your
email regularly</EM>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc3"></A> 3&nbsp;&nbsp;More About the Course Web
Site</H2>

<P>The course website will also contain lots of other useful
information relevant to the course. In particular, the course
schedule page, at:</P>

<CENTER><A HREF="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/fitelson/164/schedule.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1"><TT>http://philosophy.wisc.edu/fitelson/164/schedule.htm</TT></FONT></A></CENTER>

<P>will allow you to keep track of where we are in the course.
Current readings, paper topics, paper deadlines, lecture notes,
<EM>etc</EM>. will all be detailed chronologically on this page.
You'll notice that the schedule does not extend very far into the
future. This is because I like the course to evolve dynamically
throughout the quarter. Typically, I will have things like readings
and lectures figured out about two weeks in advance. This allows me
to make changes to the course in ``real-time,'' as the quarter
progresses.</P>

<P>I urge you to explore the course website. Many interesting links
<EM>&amp;</EM> materials can be found there.</P>

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc4"></A> 4&nbsp;&nbsp;What, When, Where, Why?</H2>

<P>Philosophy 164/264 consists of two afternoon ``power lectures''
&#91;2:15-3:30 pm TR @ <A HREF="map_200.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Building
200</A>, room <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/classroom/200-303.html" TARGET="_blank">303</A>
(<B>***NEW LOCATION AS OF 10/2***</B>)&#93;. Attendance will not
figure (explicitly) into your final grade. However, much of the
material covered in lecture will <EM>not</EM> overlap (in any obvious
way) with the readings. So, I assume everyone will attend lectures
regularly. The objectives of this course are (<EM>i</EM>) to become
familiar with some of the central issues in contemporary philosophy
of science (in particular, issues surrounding confirmation and
explanation), and (<EM>ii</EM>) to get some practice at writing
concise, analytical papers about some of these issues. As will soon
become clear, the course will be taught from a highly analytical and
critical perspective with much emphasis on the logical structure of
issues, arguments, and accounts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc5"></A> 5&nbsp;&nbsp;Papers, Exams, Grades, and
all that...</H2>

<P>We will have (<EM>i</EM>) two short paper assignments, and
(<EM>ii</EM>) a take-home final examination (essentially, a third
short paper). The first short paper will be worth 25% of your final
grade, the second paper will be worth 35% of your final grade, and
the take-home final examination will be worth 40% of your final
grade.</P>

<P>Roughly every two weeks (starting today!), I will distribute
``short paper topics.'' Usually, these will be questions and issues
that I formulate on my analysis of the readings for that
``fortnight'' of the course. Sometimes, the topics will be drawn from
other sources. Your short papers may be discussions of one (or more)
of these topics. Or, you may choose your own paper topics (but,
please discuss your topics with me first!). You will notice that the
topics I distribute are very focused and somewhat narrow. This is
intentional. What I'm looking for are concise, precise, and
analytical papers. In particular, I'd like the papers (including the
take-home final!) to be no more than 4,000 words in length (and, if
possible, between 2,000 and 3,000 words). The papers should contain a
minimum of window dressing. They should quickly set up the
issue/problem, and then (straightaway!) propose a brief and precise
analysis/resolution of it. I will meet with each student to discuss
their paper topics and papers, and I will allow (and encourage)
resubmissions of papers, if this might be beneficial (except for the
final!). I will try to provide some examples of ``model papers'' to
give you an idea of the kind of thing I'm looking for. As a rough
guideline, you might want to pick up a recent issue of the journal
<A HREF="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/journals/analysis/"><FONT SIZE="+1"><TT>A</TT></FONT><TT>NALYSIS</TT></A>.
These are the sorts of papers (in terms of structure, style, and
length) that I have in mind. Tentatively, our due dates for the
papers and the take-home final are:&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>First paper (due October 25th, worth 25% of final grade)<BR>
   <BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>Second paper (due November 29th, worth 35% of final grade)<BR>
   <BR>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>Take-home final (due December 14th - end of exam period, worth
   40% of final grade)</LI>
</UL>
