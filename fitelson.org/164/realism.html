   <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><EM>Traditionally, scientific
   </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM> asserts that the objects of
   scientific knowledge exist independently of the minds or acts of
   scientists and that scientific theories are true of that objective
   (mind-independent) world. The reference to knowledge points to the
   dual character of scientific </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM>. On
   the one hand it is a </EM><B><EM>metaphysical</EM></B><EM>
   (specifically, an ontological) doctrine, claiming the independent
   existence of certain entities. On the other hand it is an
   epistemological doctrine asserting that we can know what
   individuals exist and that we can find out the truth of the
   theories or laws that govern them.<BR>
   <BR>
   Opposed to scientific </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM> (hereafter
   just '</EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM>') are a variety of
   antirealisms, including phenomenalism and empiricism. Recently two
   others, instrumentalism and constructivism, have posed special
   challenges to </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM>. Instrumentalism
   regards the objects of knowledge pragmatically, as tools for
   various human purposes, and so takes reliability (or empirical
   adequacy) rather than truth as scientifically central. A version
   of this, fictionalism, contests the existence of many of the
   objects favoured by the realist and regards them as merely
   expedient means to useful ends. Constructivism maintains that
   scientific knowledge is socially constituted, that 'facts' are
   made by us. Thus it challenges the objectivity of knowledge, as
   the realist understands objectivity, and the independent existence
   that </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM> is after. Conventionalism,
   holding that the truths of science ultimately rest on man-made
   conventions, is allied to constructivism.<BR>
   <BR>
   </EM><B><EM>Realism</EM></B><EM> and antirealism propose competing
   interpretations of science as a whole. They even differ over what
   requires explanation, with </EM><B><EM>realism</EM></B><EM>
   demanding that more be explained and antirealism
   less.</EM></FONT></P>

   helped turn the tide toward <B>realism</B>. That movement was
   checked by two developments. In physics the quantum theory of
   1925&ntilde;6 quickly ran into difficulties over the possibility
   of a realist interpretation (see
   Q</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">UANTUM MECHANICS,

   This was a formative lesson for logical empiricism whose respect
   for developments in physics and whose positivistic orientation led
   it to brand the <B>realism</B> question as <B>metaphysical</B>, a
   pseudo-question (see
   L</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">OGICAL

   empiricist and instrumentalist trends in science and philosophy
   eclipsed scientific <B>realism</B>.<BR>
   <BR>
   The situation changed again in the 1960s, by which time science
   and its technological applications had become a ubiquitous and
   dominant feature of Western culture. In this setting philosophers
   like</FONT><A HREF="realism.html#2"><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Smart
   (1963)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#3"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Putnam
   (1975) </FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">proposed what came to be
   known as the 'miracles' argument for scientific <B>realism</B>
   (see S</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">MART,
   J.J.C</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. &szlig;3;
   P</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">UTNAM,
   H</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. &szlig;2). They argued that unless
   the theoretical entities employed by scientific theories actually
   existed and the theories themselves were at least approximately
   true of the world at large, the evident success of science (in
   terms of its applications and predictions) would surely be a
   miracle. It is easy to see, at least with hindsight, that the most
   one could conclude from scientific success, however impressive, is
   that science is on the right track. That could mean, as the
   argument concludes, on the track to truth or it could just mean on
   the track to empirical success, perhaps with deeply flawed
   representations of reality. The 'miracles' argument is
   inconclusive. Nevertheless, during the next two decades it was
   compelling for many philosophers. Indeed, during this period
   <B>realism</B> became so identified with science that questioning
   <B>realism</B> was quickly put down as anti-science.<BR>
   <BR>
   Realist orthodoxy found support in Popper's attack on
   instrumentalism, which he criticized as unable to account for his
   own falsificationist methodology </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#4"><FONT COLOR="#000000">(Popper
   1972)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">(see
   P</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">OPPER,
   K.R</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. &szlig;2). Broadening this line,
   Boyd developed an explanationist version of the 'miracles'
   argument that focused on the methods of science and tried as well
   to give proper due to the human-centred (constructivist and
   conventionalist) aspects of science emphasized by
   K</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">UHN</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
   and
   F</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">EYERABEND</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
   Boyd asks why methods crafted by us and reflecting our interests
   and limitations lead to instrumentally successful science.
   Contrasting <B>realism</B> with empiricism and constructivism, he
   finds that <B>realism</B> offers the best (indeed, the only)
   explanation. That is because, he argues, if we begin with truths
   or near-truths the methods we have crafted for science produce
   even more of the same. Since it is only <B>realism</B> that
   demands the truth of our scientific theories, then <B>realism</B>
   wins as giving the best explanation for the instrumental success
   of science. Hence, like a scientific hypothesis, <B>realism</B> is
   most likely to be true and we should believe in it.<BR>
   <BR>
   The explanationist argument is carefully framed so that we ask
   only about the instrumental success of science; that is, success
   at the observational level. To take science as successful (for
   example, truth producing) at the theoretical level would beg the
   question against empiricism and instrumentalism. Once this is
   recognized, however, we can see a significant gap in the
   reasoning. The argument is driven by a picture of science as
   generating new truths from old truths, but the explanatory issue
   raised is only about truths at the level of observation, not about
   truths in general. Antirealists might well reject this as an
   illegitimate request for explanation. If they accept it, there is
   an obvious empiricist or instrumentalist response; namely, that
   our scientific methods are made by us to winnow out instrumentally
   reliable information. If we begin with fairly reliable statements,
   the methods we have crafted for science will produce even more.
   Thus the explanation for scientific success at the instrumental
   level need not involve the literal truth of our scientific
   principles or theories, just their instrumental reliability. This
   move nicely converts the argument for <B>realism</B> as the best
   explanation of scientific success into an argument for
   instrumentalism.<BR>
   There is a second problem with the explanationist tactic, perhaps
   even more serious. The conclusion in support of <B>realism</B>
   depends on an inference to the best explanation (see
   I</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">NFERENCE TO THE BEST
   EXPLANATION</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">). That principle, to
   regard as true that which explains best, is a principle that
   antirealisms (especially instrumentalism and empiricism) deny. Van
   Fraassen, for example, regards being the best explanation as a
   virtue, but one separate from truth. (He reminds us that the best
   may well be the best of a bad lot.) Although not required, there
   could perhaps be an instrumentalist principle of inference to the
   best explanation. It would not infer to the truth of the
   explanation but to its instrumental reliability (or empirical
   adequacy) &ntilde; precisely the strategy pursued above where we
   infer instrumentalism from the instrumental success of science.
   Thus the explanationist argument uses a specifically realist
   principle of inference to the best explanation and, in so doing,
   begs the question of truth versus reliability, one of the central
   questions at issue between <B>realism</B> and antirealism.

   <H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Piecemeal realisms</FONT></H4>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inference to the best explanation
   promised the most cogent version of the 'miracles' argument. Its
   inadequacy hastened a retreat from realism's original undertaking
   as a global interpretation of science. Retreat was fostered by two
   other antirealist developments. One was the pessimistic
   meta-induction to the instability of current science, a conclusion
   based on the repeated overthrow of scientific theories
   historically and the consequent dramatic alterations in ontology.
   The other was a sharpening of the underdetermination thesis
   associated with Poincar&Egrave; and Duhem, suggesting that there
   may be empirically equivalent theories between which no evidence
   can decide (see
   U</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">NDERDETERMINATION</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">).
   Both developments tended to undermine claims for the reality of
   the objects of scientific investigation and the truth of
   scientific theories.<BR>
   <BR>
   Pursuing a salvage operation, several philosophers suggested that
   <B>realism</B> could confine itself to being a doctrine about the
   independent existence of theoretical entities ('entity
   <B>realism</B>') without commitment to the truth of the theories
   employing them. </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#5"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hacking
   (1983)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000"> proposed an 'experimental
   argument' for this entity <B>realism</B>; roughly, that if you can
   deploy entities experimentally to discover new features of nature
   (for example, use an electron gun to learn about quarks) then the
   entities must be real whether or not the covering theories are
   true (see E</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">XPERIMENT
   </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">&szlig;3). </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#6"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Cartwright
   (1983)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000"> suggested that the
   strategy of inference to the best explanation be confined to an
   inference to the causes of phenomena, since causes are
   unquestionably real. To the antirealist, however, these related
   strategies seem far from compelling. For one thing, it is not
   clear that one can so neatly disengage theoretical entities from
   their covering theories. Moreover, in both cases, we can see that
   the basis on which one is asked to draw a realist conclusion need
   support no more than a conclusion about utility or reliability. In
   Hacking's case one need conclude only that electrons are a useful
   theoretical construct (perhaps a useful fiction?) and in
   Cartwright's that certain causal hypotheses are reliable in
   certain domains.<BR>
   <BR>
   Faced with these difficulties <B>realism</B> has fragmented even
   further. Sometimes it takes an historicist turn, countering the
   pessimistic meta-induction by endorsing as real only those
   fruitful entities that survive scientific revolutions. Sometimes
   <B>realism</B> becomes highly selective in other ways; for
   example, only looking at what seems essential in specific cases of
   explanatory or predictive success, or at entities that stand out
   as supported by only the very best scientific evidence. Although
   each of these principles locates matters of scientific
   significance, it is not clear that such criteria overcome the
   general strategies that have undone global realist arguments. In
   particular they do not seem to discriminate effectively between
   what is real and what is merely useful (and so between
   <B>realism</B> and instrumentalism).

   <H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 Alternatives to
   <B>realism</B></FONT></H4>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Several alternatives to <B>realism</B>
   have developed in the course of these debates. Principle among
   them are Putnam's 'internal <B>realism</B>' </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#7"><FONT COLOR="#000000">(1981)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">
   (see P</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">UTNAM,
   H.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> &szlig;8), van Fraassen's
   'constructive empiricism' </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#8"><FONT COLOR="#000000">(van
   Fraassen 1980)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and what
   </FONT><A HREF="realism.html#9"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Fine
   (1986)</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000"> calls 'the natural
   ontological attitude', or NOA. In a chameleon-like move, Putnam
   switched from being realism's champion to its critic. Rejecting
   what he called '<B>metaphysical realism</B>' (associated with a
   'God's eye view'), Putnam proposed a perspectival position in
   which truth is relative to language (or conceptual scheme). He
   could then allow scientific claims to be true in their proper
   domain but deny that they tell the whole story, or even that there
   is a whole story to tell. His picture was that there could be
   other truths &ntilde; different stories about the world &ntilde;
   each of which it may be proper to believe. Van Fraassen's
   constructive empiricism eschews belief in favour of what he calls
   commitment. He takes the distinguishing features of <B>realism</B>
   as twofold: <B>realism</B> seeks truth as a goal and when a
   realist accepts a theory it is accepted as true. Constructive
   empiricism, by contrast, takes empirical adequacy (not truth) as
   the goal of science and when it accepts a theory it accepts it as
   empirically adequate. This involves commitment to working within
   the framework of the theory but not to believing in its literal
   truth. Unlike these others, Fine's NOA is not a general
   interpretive scheme but simply an attitude that one can take to
   science. The attitude is minimal, deflationary and expressly
   local. It is critically positive, looking carefully at particular
   scientific claims and procedures, and cautions us not to attach
   any general interpretive agenda to science. Thus NOA rejects
   positing goals for science as a whole, as realists and
   constructive empiricists do. NOA accepts 'truth' as a semantic
   primitive, but rejects any general theories or interpretations of
   scientific truth, including the perspectivalism built into
   internal <B>realism</B> and the external-world correspondence
   built into <B>realism</B> itself. NOA is perhaps better classified
   as a nonrealism than as an antirealism.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is interesting to contrast how these
   positions respond to good science. <B>Realism</B> accepts good
   science as true of an observer-independent world; internal
   <B>realism</B> accepts it as true relative to our scheme of
   things; constructive empiricism accepts it only as empirically
   adequate. NOA simply accepts it. This brings out two significant
   features of the recent debates. One is that they are more about
   the reach of evidence (what kind of acceptance is warranted) than
   about the <B>metaphysical</B> character of the objects of belief.
   The contrast also shows that major contenders, whether realist or
   not, share a basically positive attitude toward science. This has
   not always been acknowledged and a contrary suspicion still
   attaches to constructivism, which is frequently regarded as
   anti-science. <A NAME=section4></A></FONT></P>
   
   <H4><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 The constructivist
   challenge</FONT></H4>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Contemporary developments in the history
   and sociology of science have revived constructivist approaches
   (see
   C</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">ONSTRUCTIVISM</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">).
   Sharing with instrumentalism and other forms of pragmatism an
   emphasis on science as an activity, constructivism borrows the
   Marxist vocabulary of the 'production' of ideas (see
   M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">ARXIST PHILOSOPHY OF
   SCIENCE</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">) to place science among the
   manufacturing institutions. Specifically, what science makes is
   knowledge, which includes concepts and theories, along with things
   and even facts. Constructivism also emphasizes that science is
   open-ended. It highlights the role of unforced judgment in
   scientific practice, challenging the picture of a strict
   scientific method and of decision-making forced by rationality at
   every turn. The upshot is to see science as a form of human
   engagement like others; just people doing their own thing as best
   they can. Many regard this placement of science as a displacement,
   demoting science from its privileged position as the paradigm of
   rational and objective inquiry.<BR>
   <BR>
   The emphasis on human constructions may challenge the
   mind-independence that is the hallmark of realist metaphysics. The
   respective roles of the social order and of nature in shaping
   these constructions, however, differ among constructivists, making
   for strong idealism at one pole (see
   I</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">DEALISM</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
   and pragmatic <B>realism</B> at the other. Despite these
   differences, constructivism challenges the unique position that
   <B>realism</B> marks out for itself with respect to ongoing
   science. If we look beyond the relatively sophisticated arguments
   for <B>realism</B> rehearsed above, perhaps realism's major hold
   on our attention is its claim to offer the only viable setting for
   understanding scientific practice. We are told that unless we take
   scientists to be engaged in finding out about a world not of their
   own making we cannot begin to understand how science works. The
   major constructivist challenge is right here. The heart of
   constructivism consists in richly detailed studies of science in
   action. These studies set out to understand how science actually
   proceeds while bracketing the truth-claims of the area of science
   under investigation. Instead, constructivists typically employ
   little more than everyday psychology and an everyday pragmatism
   with respect to the common objects of experience. To the extent to
   which these studies succeed they paint a picture of science quite
   different from realism's, a constructivist picture that may
   undermine not only the arguments but also the intuitions on which
   scientific <B>realism</B> rests.<BR>
