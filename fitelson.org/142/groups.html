We encourage people to work in groups both on the homework and on the 
take-home components of the 2 exams.  If you work together with others 
on a homework or a take-home component, we will add 2 points to your 
grade on that assignment, provided that your group works in the 
following way:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> There are no more than 4 members of the group.<br /><br /></li>

<li> Each member of the group works individually on the homework 
    for at least one hour prior to the group's working together.  (If 
    someone shows up not having done any work on the assignment, 
    that's unacceptable).<br /><br /></li>

<li> The group works together for at least one hour.<br /><br /></li>

<li> Each person completes the work on their own.<br />
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 To obtain the additional points, list the names of the 
people in your group on your homework.  I will take that as your 
pledge that you have met the above conditions.  Specifically, copying 
the work of other group members will be regarded as 
<a href="plagiarism.html"><span class="roman">plagiarism</span></a>, and  will be considered a form of academic misconduct.  Copying someone's  homework is plagiarism and a violation of University policies on  academic integrity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The two points you earn for group work is not likely to make that big 
a difference in your final grade (it may help in borderline cases).  
But, we have found that a great many people are helped considerably 
(<em>intellectually</em>) by talking the material over with other 
students.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is not, of course, a requirement; <em>no one will be penalized 
for this</em>.  The grade ranges for the course will <em>not</em> be set on 
the assumption that people are working in groups (the same goes for 
<em>all</em> forms of extra-credit that we might offer).  So, if you 
prefer working alone or have a schedule incompatible with engaging in 
group work, that's OK.</html>
