            Introduction</strong>
        </font><ol>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On page 4 of (MCI),
                  Loux briefly describes Aristotle's argument which aims to unify
                  (or identify) his two conceptions of Metaphysics:
                (<em>i</em>)
                 the science of Being <em>qua</em>            Being, and (<em>ii</em>)
                the science of First Causes. Try to explain, in your own words (and
                as
                clearly
                as possible), how Aristotle's unifying argument (or, at least, Loux's
                 rendition of it) is supposed to work (that is, reconstruct it as
                 carefully as you can). Do you think this is a good argument? Explain.
                 Do you think Aristotle's
                two conceptions of Metaphysics can be unified (<em>i.e.</em>,  <em>are
                they</em> one and the same Science)? Explain.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why do &quot;conceptual schemers&quot; (as Loux calls them in the introduction)
                think that &quot;the world as it really is&quot; is inaccessible
                to us (<em>i.e.</em>,
                cannot be known by us)? That is, what's their <em>argument</em> for this claim?
                What do you think of this argument (as presented by Loux,. <em>e.g.</em>,
                on page 9)? Can you think of any objections to this argument?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why aren't Metaphysicians
              (in Loux's &quot;Category Theorist&quot; sense) very interested
              in existential questions like &quot;Are there summersaults?&quot;?
              (see pp. 15-17). In this connection, Loux distinguishes
              &quot;primitive&quot;
              (or &quot;underived&quot;)
              and
                  &quot;derived&quot; categories. Briefly explain this distinction.
                  (*) Do you think this distinction is a principled one, or is
                  it just a
              contingent
                  one, historically determined by the tastes of actual Metaphysicians?
                  (*) And, Does it matter (that is, is it central or important
                  to Metaphysics that it be able to distinguish basic or underived
                  categories
              from derived ones)? (*) Why (or why not)?</font></li>

      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Unit #1 Questions</strong>
        </font>
        <ol><li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clarify the sense
              in which the copula &quot;is&quot; and the relation of Exemplification
              correspond within the realist's account of predication (as described
              by Loux). How is this different than the sense in which the predicate &quot;courageous&quot; corresponds
              with the property Courage, or the way in which the proper name &quot;Socrates&quot; corresponds
              with the particular (man) Socrates? Does the realist maneuver of
              'paraphrasing' claims of the form &quot;<em>a</em> is <em>F</em>&quot; as &quot;<em>a</em> exemplifies <em>F</em>&quot; amount
              to <em>cheating</em>, on this score? That is, is the correspondence
              between &quot;exemplifies&quot; and &quot;exemplification&quot; more
              straightforward (perhaps, more like connotation?) than the relation
              between &quot;is&quot; and Exemplification? If so, is it really
              correct for realists to describe this maneuver as (mere) <em>paraphrasing</em>?
              If not, why not? How do these considerations effect your overall
              judgment of the adequacy of their account?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Compare and contrast
              Armstrong's approach to attribute agreement and predication (Armstrong
              invokes <em>states of affairs</em> as the nonlinguistic entities
              with which sentences correspond <em>as a whole</em>) with the Platonic
              scheme, and the standard realist strategies described by Loux.
              Do you think Armstrong's approach is superior or inferior (in either
              case)? Why (or why not)? If so, how does this bear on Loux's discussion
              about the standard realist approaches?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his discussion of
              the Parmenidean regress faced
              by the realist account of predication,
              Loux sketches an argument (page 39)  the conclusion
              of which seems to be &quot;...if there is a regress here, it is one
              that infects every
              attempt, realist or nominalist, at delineating the ontological
              grounds of
              subject-predicate truth.&quot;. Give a careful reconstruction of
              Loux's argument. Do you think this argument softens the impact
              of the Parmenidean regress (<em>i.e.</em>, how is this argument
              supposed to help the realist)? Bonus: Do you think this argument
              can be adapted to the
              Bradley
              regress? Explain. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>On p. 23, Loux
                distinguishes between a one-place universal and a many-place
                universal. What is the difference? Is this a substantial
            metaphysical difference? Briefly discuss the differences and similarities
            between
            one and many-place universals, and any important ramifications
            they might have for metaphysical realism.  [part of
            first graded set of study questions]</strong></font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In response to the Russellian
              paradox, Loux claims that (page 36) &quot;To avoid the paradox,
              we have no option but to deny that there is a universal associated
              with the general term 'does not exemplify itself'&quot;. Do you
              agree? Can you think of an <em>alternative</em> way to avoid the paradox?
              (Hint (question): is the <em>only</em> assumption at work here
              that the property 'does not exemplify itself' <em>exists</em>?
              Or, are there <em>other</em>            assumptions
              required to generate the paradox?).</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the problems
              with a Platonic &quot;two-worlds&quot; ontology involves the possibility
              of a 'tie' or 'connection' between particulars and universals (as
              required, for instance, by the realist theory of predication).
              How can such a connection be forged if particulars and universals
              reside in separate, independent domains? Discuss Loux's response
          to this problem (page 50). Do you find this response satisfying? Can
              you think of a better one?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Loux (pp. 67&#8211;70)
              claims that the Austere Nominalist must assume that the <em>ceteris
              paribus</em> clauses
              and adverbial expressions (in their &quot;concretizations&quot; of
              claims involving abstract reference) are <em>not fully analyzable</em> (<em>i.e.</em>,
              they must ultimately take them as <em>primitive</em>). Explain
              why Loux thinks this is the case. Does
              he give an <em>argument</em> for
                this? If not, can you think of one? Is Loux right, or is there
              a way for the
                nominalist
                to provide satisfying (and full) analyses or explications of
              their <em>ceteris paribus</em> clauses and adverbial expressions?
              If so, what might that be?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Quine claims that nominalists
              cannot say &quot;there are things the realist has in her ontology,
              but that I do not have in mine&quot; (on pain of contradiction).
              Explain why this amounts to asserting a contradiction for the nominalist
              (this problem is what Quine calls &quot;Plato's Beard&quot;). Nonetheless,
              Quine says that there is still hope for the nominalist to engage
              in serious
              debate with the realist on matters of ontology &#8211; by &quot;talking
              about the realist's sentences&quot; and &quot;what to do with them&quot;.
              How might this &quot;semantic ascent&quot; strategy work? What
              kinds of things would the
              nominalist
              need in
              their ontology to engage the realist in such a debate? Do you think
              this is what realists and nominalists are actually doing when they
              disagree about
              matters of ontology (<em>i.e.</em>, are they &quot;talking
              about each other's sentences&quot;)? Can you suggest an alternative
              (non-meta-linguistic) way of reconstructing this debate? Keep in
              mind Quine's criticisms
              of &quot;possible objects&quot; here.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Describe Quine's
                objections to the notion of a &quot;possible entity&quot; (page 44 of Loux's
                Reader).
              Do you think these objections are good reasons to banish such entities
            from our ontology?</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Explain how Russell's theory of descriptions paraphrases
              the claim ``The present king of France is bald.'' On Russell's
              account, does
            this claim come out true or false? Do you think this is the right
            answer? Answer these same questions for the claim ``Courage is a
          virtue''? [part of first graded set of study
          questions]</strong></font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Quine says:<br>
            <br>
&quot;In debating over what there is, there are still reasons for operating on a semantical
plane. One reason is to escape from the predicament noted at the beginning of
this essay: the predicament of my not being able to admit that there are things
which
McX countenances and I do not. So long as I adhere to my ontology, as opposed
to McX's, I cannot allow my bound variables to refer to
entities
which belong to McX's ontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently
describe
our disagreement by characterizing the statements which McX affirms. Provided
merely that my ontology countenances linguistic forms, or at least concrete inscriptions
and utterances, I can talk about McX's sentences.&quot;<br>
<br>
Try to explain in your own words what Quine has in mind here. Specifically,
            explain how the nominalist should interpret or understand a realist
            when they say &quot;There are universals (for instance,
          Courage).&quot; According to Quine, what ontological commitments does
          the nominalist take on, as a result of this kind of &quot;semantical&quot; reconstruction
          of realist discourse? [part of first graded set of study questions]</strong></font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sellars responds to
              the translation objection to metalinguistic nominalism by analyzing
              meanings into the functional roles of particular
            linguistic instances. Explain how Sellars does this and how it avoids
            the translation objection. If we grant Sellars' move here, it seems
            that our language now refers to kinds of functional roles of linguistic
            instances, which seem to be abstract objects. Is this a problem for
          Sellars' account? Explain why or why not.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Loux gives the following
              argument, which is supposed to expose a problem for the Trope Theorist

                  is committed to the claim that the set that is courage could
                  not have had a different membership.... On the trope theorist's
                  account, however, concrete objects, persons, are courageous just
                  in case they have a trope that is a member of the set that is
                  identical with courage. But if that set could not have had more
                  or fewer members than it does, we have the result that there
                  could not have been more or fewer courageous individuals than

            in the

            of different languages. Try to come up with an example involving

          <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>A New Problem For Trope Theory?</strong> When one combines
            the trope-theoretic account of subject-predicate discourse with the
            trope-theoretic account of abstract reference, one seems to get false
            consequences. To see this, consider the combination of the following
            two claims the trope theorist seems to be committed to:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. &quot;Courage is a virtue&quot; is true only if the set of courage
            tropes is a subset of the set of virtue tropes.<br>
            2. &quot;Socrates is courageous&quot; is true only if Socrates has
            a courage trope. <br>
            <p>Now, assuming that &quot;Courage is a virtue&quot; <em>is</em> true
              (as it <em>is</em>), we can deduce the following:</p>
            <p>3. &quot;Socrates is courageous&quot; is true only if &quot;Socrates is virtuous&quot;
              is true.<br>
              <br>
              Explain how this follows from (1) and (2), on the assumption that &quot;Courage
              is a virtue&quot; <em>is</em> true. The fact that (3) can be derived
              from the conjunction of the trope-theoretic accounts of subject-predicate
              discourse and abstract reference is <em>very bad news</em>. To
              see this more plainly, note that, since we can run this same derivation
              for <em>all</em> courageous
              people (explain how this would go!), we can then deduce from the
              conjunction of these two trope-theoretic accounts that:<br>
              <br>
            4. All courageous people are virtuous.<br>
            <br>
            But, this claim is <em>false</em>, as we have seen in our discussion
            of Austere Nominalism! Remember, it was because (4) is false that
            the Austere
            Nominalist had to bring in the primitive &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; clauses
            in their
            account of abstract reference. We have just shown that the conjunction
            of the trope theorist's accounts of abstract reference and subject-predicate
            discourse has a false consequence. Therefore, it appears that they
            can't both be true. Discuss.</p>

        <br>
          <font size="-1">Although the central premise
          of the argument (&quot;Difference of attributes
          entails difference of bundles&quot;) was formulated in bundle-theoretic
          terms, that premise is merely an instance of a more general principle
          governing the constituent-whole relation; for if it is true that difference
          in attributes entails difference in bundles, it is true only because
          it is true that difference of constituents entails difference in constituted
          wholes or complexes. But the substratum theorist no less than the bundle
          theorist construes the attributes associated with an ordinary object
          as its constituents [<em>viz</em>., (PCI)]. Accordingly, if the bundle theorist
          is committed to denying that the concrete object emerging from a change
          is ever numerically identical with that entering the change, so, it
          would seem, is the substratum theorist.</font><br>
        <br>
        This suggests that the problem
          with identification through changes in attribute is<em> the very same
          problem</em>        for both the bundle theorist and the substratum
          theorist. But, intuitively, is that right? What if a particular changes <em>all</em> of
          its attributes? Would there, on a substratum view, be anything that
          (in some sense)
          could <em>persist</em> through such a global change in attributes?
          What about on the bundle theory? [Also, see questions #2 and #3, below. As
      in #3, below, both (PCI) and its <em>converse</em> &#8211; the constituent-indiscernability
      of identicals &#8211; will be relevant here.]</font></li>

          <font size="-1">&#8230; if subject-predicate discourse presents
                problems for the bundle theorist, it presents analogous problems
                for the substratum theorist. The substratum theorist claims that
                substrata are the items to which we ultimately ascribe attributes;
                but, then, substrata had better be things we can pick out as
                identifiable objects of reference. [but] &#8230; substrata are
                bare; they are things that in themselves have no attributes.&#8230;there
                is nothing in a bare substratum, taken by itself, that would
                enable us to pick it out as something distinct from other things.
                If a bare substratum is to be identified, it can only be by reference
                to the attributes with which it is compresent. Those attributes,
                however, are just the attributes that can be truly ascribed to
                it. But, then, the substratum theorist would seem to confront
                the same sorts of difficulties he poses for the bundle theorist.</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Do you think &#8211; as
              Loux suggests here &#8211; that this problem is <em>the same problem</em>          faced
              by the bundle theorist? Or, is there a deeper problem here for
              the bundle theorist? [Hint: distinguish the <em>metaphysics
              of identity</em> (as it pertains to subjects) from the <em>epistemology
              of identification</em> (as it applies to subjects). There does,
              intuitively, seem to be a &quot;part&quot; of the identity of the
              substratum theorist's objects that is <em>independent</em> of the
              attributes it happens to have. See question #3, below.]</font></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Explain what Loux means when he says: <br>
            <br>
              <font size="-1">&#8230;if the attribute did not enter into the
              constitution of the object, that object would not exist. On the
              bundle theory, every true subject-predicate claim is a mere elaboration
              of the essence of a concrete object. And here we confront what
              is, perhaps, the central difference between between the bundle theory
              and the substratum theory; for whereas the bundle
                  theory must construe all true ascriptions of attributes as
              holding of necessity, the substratum theorist insists that none
              does.</font><br>
            <br>
            This is supposed to be <em>the</em> crucial difference between bundle
            theory and substratum theory. Do you agree with Loux that a bundle
            theorist
            must think of all the attributes of a particular as <em>necessarily</em> exemplified
            by that particular, and that the substratum theorist must <em>disagree</em> (and
            view attributes as <em>contingently</em> exemplified)? How does this
            jibe with the fact that Loux also claims that both the
            bundle
            theorist and the substratum theorist is committed to principle (PCI),
            on page 113? Doesn't changing  <em>attributes</em> imply
            changing the <em>constituents</em>? If so, why doesn't this imply
            a change in <em>identity</em> both for the bundle theorist and the
            substratum theorist (after all, they both accept (PCI))? [Note: everyone
            who accepts (PCI) is bound to accept its <em>converse</em> &#8211; the
            constituent-indiscernability of identicals &#8211; which says that
            identity entails indiscernibility with respect to constituents<em>.</em>]
            If it does, then how can what Loux says in this quote be true? Wouldn't
            it then also be
            the
            case
            from
            the point of view of the substratum theorist that &quot;if
            the attribute did not enter into the constitution of the object,
            that object would not exist&quot;?</font></p>

        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After discussing the bundle
            theory, which he claims requires particulars to have <em>all</em> of
            their attributes necessarily, and substratum theory, which he claims
            requires
            particulars to have <em>none</em> of their attributes necessarily,
            Loux (p. 123) describes the choice between these extremes as follows:<br>
          <br>
          <font size="-1">If the idea of an entity completely lacking in essential
          attributes is, as it seems to be, problematic, then the substratum
          theory is not an
        attractive option. And if it is, as it seems to be, possible for numerically
        different concrete objects to be qualitatively indiscernible, then any
        version of the bundle theory that endorses a realist interpretation of
        attributes would appear to be unacceptable. </font></font><font size="-1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It
        looks as though we have only two options: to join forces with bundle
        theorists
        like Hume and Williams who embrace a trope-theoretic interpretation of
        attributes, or to follow the austere nominalist and deny that concrete
        particulars have any ontological structure</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#8230;<br>
        <br>
        That is, Loux characterizes
        the choice between substratum theory and bundle theory as a choice between
        a theory which requires that <em>no</em> attributes be essential (or
        necessary), and a theory which accepts the Identity of Indiscernibles
        (II). Can you
        think of a reason why he doesn't express the dilemma here <em>entirely</em> in
        terms of the disagreement over how many attributes are necessary or essential?
        In fact, why does he bring in (II) at all? Isn't there a much easier
        way
        to make the choice
        of bundle theory seem unattractive &#8211; for both realists and trope
        theorists (and in a way
 that is directly related to his complaint about substratum theory), simply by
        appealing to the fact that it makes <em>every</em> attribute essential?
        This is especially puzzling, since the (II) argument doesn't apply to
        trope theory versions of bundle theory, but the &quot;superessentialist&quot;
        objection applies to both.<br>
