    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You are encouraged to read
          <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Ejimpryor/">James Pryor</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Ejimpryor/general/writing.html">&quot;Guidelines
        on Writing a Philosophy Paper.&quot;</a> This
        will be  useful for those of you with less philosophy experience
        (and perhaps even for those with more). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also, p</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">lease
          take the time to review the <a href="plagiarism.html">Guidelines on
          Plagiarism and Academic Integrity</a>. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Keep in mind: you
          are writing a philosophical essay, not a &quot;research paper.&quot; You
          aren&#8217;t
          expected to look at any texts outside of the required readings. If
          you do look
          at outside sources,
        be very
        careful to attribute ideas you have taken from them, even if you are
      only paraphrasing and not quoting.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For each of your two papers,
          you are to write a well-argued essay on
          <strong>one</strong> of the given topics (see below for
        the two sets of topics &#8211; once they are announced). Each paper should
          be about 5 pages, double-spaced, 12-point type.
        Give papers to your GSI in class, or make other arrangements
      ahead of time</font>. </li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Writing short analytical philosophy papers is a something of an art.
        There is a journal that specializes in such papers (and covers all areas
        of contemporary analytic philosophy). That journal is called <A HREF="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/journals/analysis/"><I>ANALYSIS</I></A>.
        This  is a good place to look for paradigmatic (and usually high quality)
        examples of this art form.</font></li>

      <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Paper Topics Set
            #1 (choose one)</strong></font></li>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Describe Austere Nominalism (the strongest rendition of it you
          can muster), giving one argument for it (the best one you can think
          of). Critically evaluate this argument. If you ultimately find it persuasive,
          then defend it against potential objections (the best ones you can
          think of); if you don't, criticize it. Your answer
          should
          contain some discussion of the issues of simplicity and explanatory
        primitives, discussed by Loux in connection with Austere Nominalism.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What is the relation of exemplification? How must it be restricted
            for Metaphysical Realism to have a chance, and why? Is this view
          defensible, in your view? Defend your view.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Describe Bradley's regress. Do you agree with Loux when he suggests
              that Bradley's regress is really no more troublesome for the realist
              than the Parmenidean regress(es)? Why or why not? What, ultimately,
              do you think realists should conclude from Bradley's regress (i.e.,
            how should they respond to it), and why?</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Develop and analyze one of the arguments (the one you think
                is strongest) adduced by Loux in support of Metaphysical Realism
                in
                chapter 1. (That is, select either an instance of the Attribute
                Agreement Argument,
                the Predication Argument or the Abstract Reference Argument,
              depending on which one you think is strongest.) Is this argument
              compelling,
              in your opinion? Explain why or why not.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">How does Sellars' metalinguistic nominalism represent an
                  improvement over Carnap's. What problems are there with Sellars'
                  improvements,
                according to Loux? Do you agree with him? Why or why not?</font></li>
      </ol>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Paper Topics Set
        #2 (choose one)</strong>
          </font>
          <ol>
            <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Compare and contrast Lewis' realist, non-actualist Counterpart Theory of de re modality and Plantinga's realist, actualist account of de re modality. In particular, compare and contrast the ways in which each of these accounts reconciles the indiscernibility of identicals with the naive possible world semantics rendition of &quot;Socrates contingently has five fingers on his right hand&quot;. Your discussion should cover what you take to be the most important ways in which Lewis and Plantinga disagree about modality generally and de re modality in particular, as well as those objections the each account that you think are most important and worrisome. In the end, which account of de re modality do you think is more plausible, and why?</font></li>
            <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pick your favorite account of concrete particulars (e.g., some version of bundle theory, or substratum theory, or the Aristotelian theory of particulars, etc.), and explain the conception of concrete particulars that it endorses. Your discussion should (at least) include an explanation of where your favorite theory comes down on: (i) the identity of indiscernibles, (ii) whether particulars have any attributes necessarily, (iii) whether particulars are complexes or simples. Also, you should describe what you take to be the most compelling objection to your favorite theory, and explain how you think the objection can (or should) be answered. [If you're really ambitious, you might also want to consider what consequences your favorite theory of particulars has for DE RE modal claims about particulars (e.g., as in question (1)).]</font></li>
            <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Describe the realist account of propositions, its motivation, and at least one of its applications (preferably, the application of proposition-realism that you think is most important or compelling). Then, describe your favorite version of nominalism about propositions (e.g., Quine's, or Sellars', or Prior's). Can your favorite nominalistic theory of propositions do the work that the realist theory is supposed to do (in the central application you discussed above)? What's the strongest objection against your favorite nominalistic theory of propositions, and how is it best handled?</font></li>
            <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What is the slingshot argument, and how do the Russellian theory of descriptions and facts provide a way to avoid its conclusion? More precisely: briefly outline the slingshot argument (your favorite version of it), and explain what it's key assumptions are. Then, briefly describe Russell's theory of descriptions and facts and show how this Russellian combination can provide us with a way to avoid the undesirable conclusion of the slingshot argument.</font></li>
