This paper argues that &quot;causation&quot; (as metaphysicians know and love it) is not a part of science proper, but really just a folk concept that has no home in physical theory. </font></li>

And, Vanessa's <a href="propositions.pdf">realism about propositions</a> handout has been posted. I found this handout very useful. I have compiled a list of all handouts for the course. This list now appears on the <a href="lectures.html">lecture notes</a> page. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">11/11/03: I have created a handout on <a href="de_re.pdf">&quot;De Re Modality&quot;</a>. This handout discusses five alternative theories of <em>de re</em> modality in some detail, with special attention paid to the central problem of reconciling the indiscernibility of identicals with the naive possible world semantics account of <em>de re</em> modality. I will go over this handout in detail on Thursday. That will be the end of the unit on modality. We will then move on to <a href="syllabus.html#causation">causation</a>. I will  be announcing the second set of <a href="questions.html">study questions</a> and <a href="topics.html">paper topics</a> on Thursday. NOTE:<strong> I will not be having office hours this week</strong>. I will make up for this with extra hours next week. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">11/05/03: I have created a handout on <a href="accessibility.pdf">&quot;Accessibility and Modality&quot;</a>. This handout fleshes out the role of the &quot;accessibility relation&quot;, both in the formal semantics and logic of modality, and in applications of possible worlds semantics to problems in metaphysics (and epistemology). This serves as a useful supplement to my lectures on modality (in which I did not have enough time to really get into the details of accessibility between possible worlds, and the role it plays both formally and in applications). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">11/03/03: Links added to papers [<a href="van_fraassen_verbal.pdf">here</a> and <a href="rosen_fictionalism.pdf">here</a>] by <a href="http://webware.princeton.edu/vanfraas/">van Fraassen</a> and <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/philosph/bios/rosen.htm">Rosen</a> on non-realist accounts of modality and <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ap85/papers/PhilThesis.html">possible worlds</a>. Link to Vanessa's handout on realism about propositions to be posted soon (stay tuned).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/30/03: I have added two useful links [<a href="http://philarete.home.mindspring.com/philosophy/events.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu/fac/boardmaw/Notes_Dav_Ment_Event.html">here</a>] to discussions about <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/kim.html">Kim</a> and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/">Davidson</a> (and Quine) on events. I have also added a link to a <a href="quine_events.pdf">paper</a> by <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Quine.html">Quine</a> which critiques Davidson's account of events (and which led ultimately to Davidson's abandonment of his causal individuation criterion). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/22/03: I have created a <a href="slingshot.pdf">handout
          on two versions of the slingshot argument</a>.
      This is far more detailed than my lecture notes, and it also discusses a
      stronger version of the argument due to <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Godel.html">G&ouml;del</a>. I have also added a link
      to <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/%7Ejohn/PHILPAPERS/evading.pdf">a
      nice paper</a> by <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/%7Ejohn/">John Perry</a> on an alternative way to evade the slingshot
      argument.</font></li>

            list</a> (in the section on propositions &amp; their neighbors) to
            a <a href="neale.pdf">paper</a> by <a href="http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/FACSTAFF/BIOS/neale.html">Stephen
            Neale</a> on <a href="http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/davidson.html">Davidson</a>'s <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy.department/modules/logic/PHILLOG.HTM">slingshot
            argument</a> (scroll down to see a nice

            entry on the slingshot</a>). Neale's recent book <em><a href="http://www.oup.co.uk/isbn/0-19-924715-3">Facing
            Facts</a></em> is a terrific source on this argument, and on facts
    in general.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/16/03: I have created a handout on <a href="liar.pdf">Realism, Propositions,
      and the Liar Paradox</a>. This handout explains (1) why Russell's theory
      of descriptions <em>cannot</em> save the realist from <em>either</em> version
      of the liar paradox, and (2) how the
      Fregean theory
      of descriptions <em>can</em> save the realist from <em>one</em> version
      (the &quot;strong&quot; one!) of the liar, but <em>not</em> from the other
      version (ironically, the so-called &quot;weak&quot; one!). This is a rather
      subtle handout, but it should be useful.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/15/03: I have added a few new links to our <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Efitelson/125/syllabus.html#schedule">reading
        list</a> (in the section
      on propositions). These links  pertain to the Sea Battle </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">puzzle, and the
      problem
      of future contingents (which I discussed briefly in lecture). I particularly
      recommend <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Ejmacf/index.html">John
      MacFarlane</a>'s
      paper (and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prior/">Prior</a>'s

    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/06/03: I have posted a <a href="hacking.pdf">paper</a> by
        <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/ihpst/html/hacking.html">Ian Hacking</a> on
        the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-indiscernible/">Identity
        of Indiscernibles</a> (II), which relates the problem to the
        (early) modern debate about space and </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">time. I have also posted a <a href="aristotle.pdf">handout</a> on &quot;Aristotle's Division of the World&quot; (from
        a course I taught on Aristotle some years ago), which may be useful for
        thinking about Aristotelian substance (compare <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/">Aristotle's
        Metaphysics</a>).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">10/04/03: I have created a <a href="rigidity.pdf">handout</a> on
        rigidity, abstract reference, and predication, which explains how trope
        theory and
      austere nominalism can manage
      to get abstract claims to be <em>necessarily</em> true (without saying anything
      crazy). I have also added to <a href="syllabus.html#schedule">our
