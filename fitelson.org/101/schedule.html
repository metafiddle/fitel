<p><strong>Readings</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We will be working through approximately the first 7 chapters of Richard Feldman's 1999 text <A 
HREF="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Reason-and-Argument/9780136246022.page"><I>Reason and 
    Argument</I></A>.   <strong>Chapter 1 of the text can be downloaded <a href="feldman_ch1.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>
  <p>It is important that everyone does <B>all</B> the assigned readings <B>before</B> lectures are given each week.  You should try to come to 
    lecture with a relatively good sense of what Feldman is saying in the 
    assigned readings for the week.  My lectures will be designed to clarify 
    and explain the distinctions and techniques covered in the text.  It should be clear from my <a href="notes.html">lecture notes</a> where we are in the readings. </p>
  <p>From time 
    to time, I will supplement the text with my own <A 
HREF="notes.html">handouts</A>.  But, for the most part, we will work
    strictly within the framework set-up by Feldman.
  </p>

<p><strong>Homeworks</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every other week, I will assign a homework which you will have two weeks to complete.  Here is a schedule of those assignments (this will evolve as the semester unfolds -- so stay tuned). The homeworks are worth <strong>40%</strong> of your final grade.<strong> No late homeworks will be accepted </strong>(except in very rare circumstances), but we will drop your lowest HW score. Here is a schedule of the HWs. Stay tuned &mdash; this will evolve as the semester unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Beginning on Feb. 10, we will have an in-class quiz (roughly) every other Thursday (when no homework is due). These quizzes will take around 25 minutes each. There will be 6 such quizzes throughout the semester. The quizzes are worth <strong>25%</strong> of your final grade.<strong> </strong> <strong>There will be no make-up quizzes</strong>. But, we will drop your lowest quiz score. Here is a schedule of the quizzes (with the material they will cover). Basically, the quizzes will cover the <a href="notes.html">material in lectures</a> since the last quiz. Stay tuned &mdash; this will evolve as the semester unfolds.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quiz #1 (2/10/11)</strong>. This quiz will cover the material from the first few weeks of <a href="notes.html">lecture</a>. See <a href="notes_7-2x2.pdf">my 2/8/11 lecture</a> for brief discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz #2 (2/24/11)</strong>. This quiz will cover the material from chapter 2 on <em>rational belief &mdash;&nbsp;pages 33-48 of the text.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Quiz #3 (3/10/11)</strong>. This quiz covered material from chapter 3 and chapter 4 (22 T/F) questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz #4 (3/31/11)</strong>. This quiz will be a <em>re-do </em>of quiz #3 (since I mistakenly gave that quiz prematurely).</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz #5 (4/14/11)</strong>. This quiz will involve 5 true/false questions from chapter 5, and three short argument reconstructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz #6 (4/28/11)</strong>. This quiz will involve 2 short answer questions about reconstructing  arguments, and one argument reconstruction problem.</li>
  </ul>
